# Nibble or Gorge

Come learn and contribute to a growing list of dietary and allergy conscious recipes! Our goal is to make sure that anyone who is struggling to stick to a certain dietary restriction or preference can get a little inspiration to change up their meals! It's so easy to get stuck in a routine of eating the same meals over and over again.

## Technologies Used

In this application, there was a mix of technologies used.
Javascript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, ByCryptjs, Connect-Mongo, Dotenv, Express-Session, and React

## Getting Started

Get started at this link here:

Make sure to install the proper dependencies via:
`npm init -y
npm install bcryptjs connect-mongo dotenv express express-session jsonwebtoken jsx-view-engine method-override mongoose morgan react`

I recommend taking a look at the server.js file and then the models. This will give you the basis upon which this application was built. Take a peek at each of the views and controllers. Then I recommend playing around. Look over the site and have fun!

## Next Steps

In the future, I'll be looking to add in sort capabilities for the recipes by overall rating, adding in uploading your own photos for the recipes, adding in a save function, and adding onto that save function by allowing you to edit your own version of the recipes you save. I'm also considering adding users/usernames to the comments and the ability to edit and delete them, or let the creator of the recipe be able to delete comments.

### Early Wireframe

I ended up changing the general layout as I didn't love the displays in the recipes/dietary restrictions. I prefer all of the restrictions be viewable with all of the recipes showing up so you can browse them all. In the future, I'd like to limit how many display at one and give each dietary restriction its own view page.
